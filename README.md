# WorkflowRepresentation
========================

### Dynamic Diaporama

The "diapo" pages are dynamically generated (Javascript updates the DOM), based on a JSON init page generated by the server.

### CMS based

Developped as a Spip Plugin

The editorial object "Article" has been retaken, and completed with custom DB columns, and a custom explorer in the back-office.

Allows to show any chosen children as a diaporama, by simply tagging the parent-node.

### Dataflow Graphs

Dedicated, JSON-based **graph** format, displayed in an Html5 canvas. 

Allows nesting and multiple parents.

Allows zooming & panning.

Dedicated editor (experimental, but functionnal, though)

### Freely formatted charts

Dedicated, JSON-based **chart** formats, displayed in an Html5 canvas.

The app reads a fixed JSON dataset on the server, and then uses the return value of a user-defined javascript function as the working dataset : any processing, filtering, reformatting can be done before displaying the chart. When downloaded once, the remote dataset is cached. You're then able to reuse it in other graphs without latency.

At this time, 2 different, but highly elaborated and customizable chart-types are available : histogram & points-cloud
